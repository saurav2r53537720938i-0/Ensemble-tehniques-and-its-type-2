    "Bagging(Boottstrap Aggregating) reduce overfitting in decsion tree by reduces overfitting in decsion tree by creating multiple bootstrap samples random samples with replacement from orginal dataset and traning a seprate decsion tree on each sample. Since each tree is trained on a diffrent subset of the data they may capture diffrent patterns and noise in the data when making predctions baggingg average the predction of all tree or takes a majority vote for classfication which tends to reduce variamce to a single decsion tree"
